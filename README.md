## About Me :boy:

I am a full-stack developer because I like to build. Yes, I like to build, you didn't read that wrong.

When I was a kid I was always asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I didn't know what to answer, but what I did know was that when I was on vacation at the beach with my parents I was the kid who made the biggest sand castles (or so I still believe, don't take away my illusion).

Maybe it doesn't seem to have any relation with being a full-stack developer but for me it does. 

When I was a kid I used to build sand castles and now I build applications and web pages. As a kid I used shovels, buckets and sand and now I use a computer, keyboard and mouse. As a kid I made my parents and the other kids who wanted to help me build my wonderful castle happy and now I make people happy who can sell their products and services thanks to me.

wow! 

Now that I am writing these words I realize that I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up, but now that I am I realize that I do what I liked to do when I was a kid... build.

## My Tech-Stack :hammer_and_wrench:

This is where I tell you everything I know. Yes, I know what you are thinking... ‚Äújust another person telling me the same old crap, who knows what is true of everything he says here...‚Äù.

I understand you! 

That's why I leave you here the [link](#check-this-out-eyeglasses) to one of the projects I love the most and the rest of the work I've been doing so you can see what I know how to do, but for real! :wink:

But if you want to go to the boring stuff first, here is my **tech-stack**:
